# Hough Transform for Line Detection

## Description
This project implements the Hough Transform algorithm to detect lines in images. The Hough Transform is a robust technique used in image analysis to identify geometric shapes, particularly lines, in a given image. This project demonstrates how to apply this technique to detect lines in real-time image feeds.

## Key Features
- Real-time line detection using the Hough Transform.
- Ability to process images from various sources (camera, video files).
- Visualization of detected lines overlayed on the original image.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hough-transform-line-detection.git
   cd hough-transform-line-detection

# Hough Transform Overview
The Hough Transform works by transforming points in the image space into a parameter space. In the case of line detection, each point in the image corresponds to a curve in the Hough space. The intersection of these curves indicates the presence of a line in the image. The steps involved include:

Edge Detection: Using Canny or Sobel edge detectors.
Hough Space Accumulation: Mapping edge points to the Hough space.
Line Extraction: Identifying peaks in the Hough space to determine line parameters.
Example
To detect lines in a sample image, run:

```bash
Copy
python line_detection.py --source sample_image.jpg
